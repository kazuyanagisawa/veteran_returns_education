# Project Log — Returns to Education (Veterans, ACS 2022)

## 2025-10-21 — Project Initialization
- Created GitHub repo and local project folder
- Switched from Python to R for econometrics focus
- Added .Rproj structure and .gitignore
- Downloaded ACS 2022 veterans-only dataset from IPUMS

## 2025-10-22 — Data Cleaning (01_clean_acs.R)
- Imported and cleaned ACS data
- Filtered working-age veterans (18–64) with valid wages
- Collapsed EDUCD into 5 education categories (<HS, HS, Some/AA, BA, BA+)
- Created binary "any_disability" variable
- Exported cleaned dataset (acs_veterans_clean.rds)

## 2025-10-22 — Descriptive Statistics (02_descriptive_stats.R)
- Summarized mean, median, 10th, 90th percentiles of income
- Plotted income distributions and average earnings by education
- Added gender and disability comparisons
- Exported summary CSVs and figures to /outputs

## 2025-10-22 — Regression Analysis (03_regression.R)
- Estimated baseline and extended log(earnings) regressions
- Applied robust SEs (HC1)
- Exported HTML and TXT tables + predicted earnings plot
- Next: interpret coefficients and write memo results section

## 2025-10-23 — Regression Analysis and Project Milestone

**Summary:**  
Completed full econometric workflow for “Returns to Education Among U.S. Veterans (ACS 2022).”  
All scripts (01–03) are finalized, tested, and reproducible.  
Outputs include cleaned datasets, descriptive summaries, regression tables, and formatted comparison results.

**Work Completed:**
- Finalized data cleaning (`01_clean_acs.R`):
  - Filtered veterans aged 18–64 with valid wages.
  - Created ordered education groups: <HS, HS, Some/AA, BA, Some GS*, MA, GD.
  - Added `any_disability` binary indicator.
- Completed descriptive analysis (`02_descriptive_stats.R`):
  - Summarized earnings by education, gender, and disability.
  - Exported tables (`summary_by_education.csv`, `summary_gender_disability.csv`).
  - Generated figures: `fig_earnings_distribution.png`, `fig_earnings_by_education.png`, `fig_gender_edu_boxplot.png`.
- Completed regression analysis (`03_regression.R`):
  - Modeled log(earnings) as a function of education, demographics, disability, and worker class.
  - Applied robust (HC1) standard errors.
  - Produced outputs: regression tables (TXT, HTML), predicted earnings figure, and formatted model comparison summary (CSV, Markdown, LaTeX).

**Key Results:**
- Each education step ≈ +118% higher earnings on average.
- Female veterans ≈ −34% compared to male veterans, holding controls constant.
- Veterans with disabilities ≈ −26% lower earnings.
- Class of worker (public/self-employed) ≈ +25% earnings premium.
- Earnings peak near age 49 (concave age pattern).
- Model R²: 0.07 → 0.13 → 0.14 as controls added.

**Next Steps:**
- Draft = memo summarizing results and interpretation.
- Refine visualizations (optional: confidence intervals or marginal effects).
- Include formatted tables in memo appendix.
- Discuss causal interpretation limitations and contextualize results with veteran education research.

✅ *Core analysis phase complete — transitioning to memo writing.*
