# Project Log — Returns to Education (Veterans, ACS 2022)

## 2025-10-21 — Project Initialization
- Created GitHub repository and initialized local R project.
- Switched from Python to R to focus on econometric modeling.
- Added `.Rproj` structure and `.gitignore` for reproducibility.
- Downloaded 2022 ACS microdata (veterans only) from IPUMS.

---

## 2025-10-22 — Data Cleaning (`01_clean_acs.R`)
- Imported ACS data and applied filters for working-age veterans (18–64).
- Excluded zero or missing wage observations.
- Collapsed `educd` codes into five education groups: `<HS`, `HS`, `Some/AA`, `BA`, `Some GS*`.
- Created `any_disability` binary variable based on disability indicators.
- Cleaned variable names using `janitor::clean_names()`.
- Exported cleaned dataset as `outputs/acs_veterans_clean.rds`.

---

## 2025-10-22 — Descriptive Statistics (`02_descriptive_stats.R`)
- Computed summary statistics for veterans’ earnings (mean, median, 10th/90th percentiles).
- Grouped results by education, gender, and disability status.
- Created and exported summary tables:
  - `summary_by_education.csv`
  - `summary_gender_disability.csv`
- Produced and saved visualizations:
  - `fig_earnings_distribution.png`
  - `fig_earnings_by_education.png`
  - `fig_gender_edu_boxplot.png`
- Verified consistency between descriptive and regression datasets.

## 2025-10-23 — Regression Analysis (`03_regression.R`)

**Summary:**  
Completed regression modeling for “Returns to Education Among U.S. Veterans (ACS 2022).”  
All models were estimated using log-transformed wage income, sequentially adding demographic and occupational controls.  
Final script implements both polynomial and treatment contrast approaches for education effects.

**Work Completed:**
- Baseline model (`m1`): log(wage) ~ education group (orthogonal polynomial contrasts).
- Supplementary baseline (`m1_treat`, `m1_treat_corrected`):
  - Estimated treatment contrast models (dummy coding) for group-to-group wage gaps.
  - Exported comparative output via `stargazer` to `.txt` and `.html` tables.
- Extended models:
  - `m2`: Added age, age², and gender controls.
  - `m3`: Added disability status and class of worker (public/self-employed).
- Applied robust (HC1) standard errors using `lmtest::coeftest()` and `sandwich::vcovHC()`.
- Exported all regression outputs:
  - `returns_to_education.txt`
  - `returns_to_education.html`
  - `m1_contrast_comparison.txt`
  - `m1_treatment_summary.txt`
  - `model_comparison_summary.csv`
- Generated predicted earnings visualization:
  - `fig_predicted_earnings.png`

### **Key Findings**
| Variable / Effect | Interpretation |
|--------------------|----------------|
| **Education** | Each additional education step corresponds to roughly **+118% higher earnings** on average (log-linear specification). |
| **Female (vs Male)** | Female veterans earn approximately **34% less**, holding age, education, and other factors constant. |
| **Any Disability** | Veterans reporting a disability earn roughly **26% less**, ceteris paribus. |
| **Class of Worker (Public/Self-Employed)** | Associated with a **+25% wage premium**, compared to private wage/salary workers. |
| **Age** | Wages rise with age but exhibit a concave relationship, peaking around **age 49**. |
| **Model Fit (R²)** | Improves from **0.07 → 0.13 → 0.14** across Models 1–3 as covariates are added. |

---

### **Interpretive Note**
Polynomial and treatment contrast models yield nearly identical fitted wage profiles, confirming a **smooth, monotonic increase** in earnings across education levels among veterans.  
This suggests that veterans’ returns to education follow a consistent, log-linear pattern without strong nonlinearity.

## 2025-10-24 — Extended Regression Analysis (Race, Ethnicity & Robustness)

**Summary:**  
Expanded the regression framework to include race and ethnicity controls and tested robustness by gender and disability subgroups. This completes the analytical phase of the “Returns to Education Among U.S. Veterans (ACS 2022)” project, providing a full picture of how demographic and health characteristics interact with education in determining earnings.

**Work Completed:**
- Added `race_factor` and `hispanic_factor` categorical variables to regression models.  
- Estimated Model 4 (race/ethnicity controls), improving model fit from **R² = 0.143 → 0.149**.  
- Calculated education milestone fractions: **2.3 %** of veterans have less than high school, **35.4 %** have college +.  
- Conducted robustness regressions by subgroup:  
  - **Gender split:** Male vs. Female.  
  - **Disability split:** With vs. Without Disability.  
- Exported new outputs:  
  - `returns_to_education_race.txt`  
  - `education_fractions.csv`  
  - `robustness_gender_disability.txt`

**Key Findings:**
- Education remains a strong positive predictor of earnings across all groups.  
- **Men and non-disabled veterans** show the highest returns to education and best model fit.  
- **Female veterans** display similar returns but with greater variance and a larger public/self-employment premium.  
- **Disabled veterans** earn less overall, with weaker education returns (R² = 0.094).  
- **Racial and ethnic wage gaps** persist even after controlling for education, age, and class of work.
